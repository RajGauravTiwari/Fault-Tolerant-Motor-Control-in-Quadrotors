CODE_FOLDER: 
- Unzip the archive with admin privileges to avoid errors
- Contains all code for motor failure detection and the control algorithm implemented.
- Includes all ROS2 Workspaces used and source files for PX4 autopilot which contains the embedded code for motor failure detection.

SIMULATION_DATA:
- This contains all the sensor data (acclerometer, gyroscope and magentometer) that were recorded during the motor failure flight simulation to examine these values pre, during and post failure.

SIMULATION_VIDEOS:
- It contains all the detection tests during the several motion cases like during Roll, Pitch, Yaw, Hover and automated missions.
- Tests were conducted with and without noise (deviation from ideal conditions like wind). The files with a "_NOISE" suffix refer to the ones that have a windy environment.
